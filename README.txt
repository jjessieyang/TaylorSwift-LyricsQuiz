### Reflection
    I really enjoyed doing this project since it forced me to learn something. Despite
    how simple the concept of the project is, I like how much creativity it encourages. I 
    definitely wish I started earlier because I wanted to add more to the user interface. 
    I struggled with understanding using React and APIs, and I still don't to be honest.
    Overall, this project was fun, regardless of the fact that it's for an application.
